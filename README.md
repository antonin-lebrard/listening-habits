# listening-habits

Try to represent listening habits by artists from last fm scrobbled tracks.

- Aggregate all listens of one last fm account
- Regroup them by artists
- Display in a timeline all listens of it through time

### Three displays available:

#### 1. Web view using the timeline charts of this library: https://github.com/vasturiano/timelines-chart, should be the better version

#### 2. Web view using no library, ugly, but somewhat usable

#### 3. Generated Image, kind of beautiful from afar, but not really usable
